#### Description:

Todo app on the go which helps you to keep tracking all your todo's & notes.

Project built by REACT.Js Including Login for security using login with google account, user friendly,keep track every single todo or note for every user, ability to update or check and delete your todo.

#### Login:

For login page i used Firebase Authentication with pop up for easy and convenient customer login.

#### Header && Footer:

Keep both with the minimal information about app and current user as much as i can for elegant design.
Header contain ( APP Name, User Image from his account, LOGOUT button )
Footer Contain Author.

#### Firebase file:

Where all config for our database and Authentication happen to use them cross whole app.

#### index file:

This will be the bridge between our HTML file and react Components.

#### APP && Todo Files:

Here the magic happen where you mix everything togerther to get the final product as:
    ((TODO FILE))
    Where all Todo's rendered inside very nice Material-UI design along with the model which comes handly to modify your todo any time.
    ((APP FILE))
    Where creating the basic structure for my app as Input & submit button & Letter Counter ...etc along with all logic to speak with my database for saving notes per every user seperatlyfor components styling i mix between Material-ui styling and my own style file for TODO AND APP Files.

#### HTML File:

As known with react project HTML file i keep it on very simple version including the link only to react components.
And images used in that project and manifest to including setting for mobile version.
create simple logo for my app.
